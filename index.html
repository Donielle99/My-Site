        <h3>Web Development </h3>
        <p> When I was in middle school I started coding for fun between studying for my classes, but I never thought about making a career out of it. After graduating college with a degree in biology, I often found myself wondering: What do I enjoy? How can I make a career out of it? That is when I discovered Web development. I wanted to combine my love of computers, creativity, and logic which led me to become a full-stack web developer. </p>

        <p>I've always had a passion of helping others. Whether it's giving back to the community, making people smile, listening to someone about their day, or giving advice. </p>
